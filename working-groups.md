# Working Group Policy

## Role of Working Groups

Working Groups are a key mechanism for the Design 4 Democracy (D4D) Coalition (“the Coalition”) Advisory Board Members, Core Partners and Coalition Members to convene and coordinate activities in particular subject areas and to engage with Coalition Members around the world. Working Groups provide a lightweight governance structure within which Partners and Members can drive activities as they see fit, while still ensuring that the Advisory Board and other stakeholders have awareness and can provide support wherever needed.

## Establishing a Working Group

A Working Group can be established for any subject relating to the objectives of the Coalition, given sponsorship by at least one Core Partner or Member, a clear terms of reference and general consensus by the Advisory Board. In general, Working Group scope should be broad enough to warrant sustained engagement among Members and Partners but specific enough to be differentiated from other existing and potential Working Groups. Working Groups may undertake one or multiple projects, but D4D Coalition projects are not required to be sponsored by or housed within a Working Group.

To form a Working Group, the sponsor(s) can propose a topic for consideration by other Members of the Coalition. There is no formal process for proposing a Working Group at this time, but possible steps include: 

The sponsor(s) propose(s) a topic for consideration or refinement to peers and the Advisory Board.
It is recommended that the sponsor(s) consult(s) with Members or Partners on the initiative, both to inform the Working Group’s approach, determine the level of interest and surface relevant stakeholders. This process can be lightweight and informal, and the sponsoring organization maintains latitude to determine scope and approach.   
The sponsor(s) would then create a basic terms of reference for the Working Group and a general plan of action to share with the Advisory Board, for final comments and input.  

## Working Group Sponsor Responsibilities

While each Working Group will determine its own scope, strategy, and processes, the Working Group sponsor(s) agree(s) to ensure certain key activities and norms are met to maintain the integrity of the D4D Coalition as a whole. These include:

Providing overall coordination and oversight of the Working Group to ensure that it remains aligned with the D4D Coalition’s mission and governance, for example its Funding and Conflicts Policy.
Providing updates to the Advisory Board on Working Group activities at periodic Advisory Board meetings and as needed.
