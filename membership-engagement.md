# Membership & Engagement Policy

## Strategic Principles

This document lays out a basic set of categories through which organizations can participate in the Design 4 Democracy (D4D) Coalition (“the Coalition”), along with engagement strategies for the Coalition in reaching out to each of these categories. This strategy is built on a handful of key principles:

The Coalition is designed to be decentralized and enable “big tent” participation. The goal is to minimize administrative overhead and to enable broad ownership and participation in the D4D Coalition.
The Coalition believes in building “with,” not “for.” The goal is to provide opportunities for frontline organizations to provide strategic direction and programming priorities.
Membership in the Coalition benefits from a wide diversity of organizational membership. This includes, among other things, diversity of geography, political leanings, and issue focus.    
The Coalition is seeking to make change through sustained, long-term engagement, building, where possible, on existing initiatives. 

## Membership and Engagement Structure

There are five roles that individuals and organizations can play in the D4D Coalition: Advisory Board Member; D4D Coalition Member; Core Partner; Donor and/or Technology Partner; and Stakeholder or Informal Partner.  

### Advisory Board Members

Advisory Board members participate as individuals, rather than as representatives of their organizations, and serve renewable two-year terms. They are democracy and civic tech leaders from around the world whose mandate is to provide expert advice and lightweight oversight of the Coalition and its activities to ensure that it remains effective and true to its mission. The D4D Coalition Advisory Board represents the founding advisory body of the Coalition; it is intended as a consultative mechanism to the community, rather than a formal governing body. Its role is to help advise on the the charter and governance structure of the Coalition, as well as to set ethical standards regarding tech industry, philanthropic and government funding for the Coalition’s activities. The organizations that Advisory Board members represent in their personal and professional capacities may also participate in the Coalition as Partners or Members. Employees and representatives of for-profit tech companies are generally not eligible for membership on the advisory board; although non-profit tech foundations or their subsidiaries are eligible and exemptions may be made by the Advisory Board in cases where the relationship does not pose a significant conflict of interest.  

Given busy schedules, the Coalition is happy to work with the Advisory Board members to accommodate the best means for their engagement, whether that is in-person, by sending a deputy to represent them at D4D Coalition meetings, or by working with them asynchronously to include their feedback and input. The Advisory Board is intended to operate primarily on the basis of consensus.   

### D4D Coalition Members 

D4D Coalition Members are frontline civil society organizations whose work aligns with the Coalition’s mission and who can benefit from participation in the Coalition’s programming. D4D Coalition Members can come from any number of disciplines, including academic institutions, election monitoring organizations, fact-checking organizations, civic tech groups, democracy NGOs or others. Groups who would like to become Members must publicly support the D4D Coalition’s mission, commit to following the core principles of the Coalition and indicate their bona fides as a genuine organization committed to advancing D4D Coalition objectives. 

No membership dues are anticipated, just a commitment to the mission and a willingness to associate and collaborate with the other Members of the Coalition to advance the shared mission of the community.  

It is the objective of the Coalition to provide concrete benefits to Members, whether cloud credits for work that advances the Coalition objectives; security keys or other cybersecurity tools that may be of assistance to their work; access to Coalition listservs and newsletters; access to small grants programs that may be operated for Coalition Members, or similar services.   

It is proposed that formal membership would not initially be open to political parties, election management bodies or government agencies — given the risks of politicization or the use of membership as a tacit endorsement; although this policy may be revisited periodically in consultation with the Advisory Board.   Certain matters may be put to the membership for their endorsement, including a particular position paper or set of recommendations, but Coalition Members would be free to endorse or not endorse these positions as they see fit.    

### Core Partners 

Core Partners are intergovernmental or civil society organizations who support work central to the mission of the Coalition at a level exceeding the contributions of typical Members. Core Partners, like Members, may use the D4D Coalition brand to advance work that is consistent with the mission of the Coalition; are expected to endorse the D4D Coalition’s mission and core values; and help, when appropriate, to promote and leverage the D4D Coalition brand. Given these Core Partners’ support for Coalition projects and programming, as well as their potential to help mobilize resources for the Coalition, there is particular value to coordination between and among the Core Partners and the Advisory Board with respect to D4D Coalition activities and resource mobilization efforts. Accordingly, Core Partners are invited to observe Advisory Board meetings and participate in and otherwise contribute to activities related to the Coalition’s general administration and coordination. Core partners are expected to actively promote the D4D Coalition and to play a key role in management, whether through support of a particular Working Group, resource mobilization efforts, or significant in-kind or financial contributions. 

### Donors and Technology Partners 

The D4D Coalition may accept support, in funding and in-kind, from a range of bilateral donors, foundations, philanthropists and technology partners, provided the assistance is disclosed to the Advisory Board, which may express reservations regarding the nature of their support, and any conditions attached to it. All Core Partners and Coalition Members are able, and are encouraged, to mobilize resources in support of the Coalition. Donor restrictions involving the sharing of data, or involving non-disclosure agreements, should be reviewed by the Advisory Board in advance. The Coalition has put in place a Funding and Conflicts Policy to provide a firewall between funding partners, including tech firms, and Coalition strategy. In the case of tech partners, there must be, in addition to funding, an expressed intention to collaborate and work with the Coalition Members, particularly to ensure the remediation of identified democratic deficits on their platforms.     

### Stakeholders and Informal Partners 

In addition to the groups outlined above, there are a variety of other stakeholders with which the D4D Coalition is expected to engage. Initially, political parties will not be invited to join the Coalition as Members or Partners, but will likely receive a range of training and capacity-building assistance, as well as have opportunities to participate in Working Groups or other D4D Coalition activities. Similarly, election management bodies or other governmental entities are not anticipated as formal Members of the Coalition, but may participate in D4D Coalition Working Groups and other activities.
